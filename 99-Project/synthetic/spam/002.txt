Subject: RE

I am John Belcher. I am an American soldier presently on active service in
Afghanistan. I served with the Third Infantry Division in Iraq, before
thousand of my lucky colleagues were pulled out in August Last year, leaving
me among the unlucky ones drafted to Afghanistan where I am serving presently.
I found your contact detail in a address journal am seeking your assistance
to evacuate the sum of $7,000,000.00 to you as long as I am assured that
it will be safe in your care until I complete my service here in Afghanistan.
This is not stolen money and there are no dangers involved. Do get back to
me with your response and i will forward more information to you.

Respectfully submitted.
John Belcher
