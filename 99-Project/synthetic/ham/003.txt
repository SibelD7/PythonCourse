Subject: License for generated files

Hello.

Today I added generated file to QCA repo. This commit
https://invent.kde.org/libraries/qca/-/commit/cf929ce541b48e36a54691a37b31211d17334bf7.
And got such email mesage: The files marked with a * at the end have a
non valid license. Please read:
https://community.kde.org/Policies/Licensing_Policy and use the headers
which are listed at that page.

So which header/license I should use in my case?
