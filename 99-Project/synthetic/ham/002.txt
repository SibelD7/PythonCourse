Subject: Recent breakage in kwallet

Hi all,
Recently, the package of KWallet framework for neon (devel unstable,
package built out of current master state) seems to be broken: kwallet
now can't open anymore wallets previously created (it works if the
local kwallet data is deleted and recreated)
the weird thing is that it seems that with a manual build it works instead.
